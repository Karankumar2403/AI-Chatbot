AI CHAT BOT(CHATTERLY)
🎯 Check it out here: https://682511ee2513bd483c33be5d--fantastic-rugelach-0793aa.netlify.app/

🤖 What’s it all about?
This isn’t just any chatbot — it's smart, it’s interactive, and it’s powered by OpenAI. Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no fancy frameworks here!)
You type a question, and it instantly responds like a personal assistant you never knew you needed. It's like having a conversation with your tech-savvy best friend who happens to live on the internet. 🤖✨

🌟 Why did I build it?
Simple: I wanted to push the limits of my frontend skills and take my understanding of APIs, AI, and real-time interactivity to the next level. I didn’t just want to build a static page — I wanted to create something that actually does something and feels like a real experience.

This project became my playground for:
💡 API integration — sending prompts to OpenAI and handling the responses smoothly
⚙ Async JavaScript — ensuring the bot’s always responsive, even when waiting for AI replies
🎨 UI/UX design — building a sleek, minimalist chat interface that’s as pretty as it is functional
🚀 Live deployment — turning it from a code sandbox into a full-fledged web app hosted on Netlify

🧠 What I learned along the way:
✅ OpenAI API — how to communicate with AI in a way that feels natural (and works!)
✅ Async JavaScript — embracing the async life without losing my mind 😅
✅ Building a real-time UI — juggling user input, API calls, and keeping everything smooth
✅ Deploying & Debugging — from local development to real-time bug fixes on Netlify

⚠ The struggles I faced (and overcame):
Managing async calls — nothing like waiting for AI to respond while keeping the UI snappy!

Handling edge cases — empty input? Long responses? Error messages? I had to account for it all!

Making it mobile-friendly — building a chat UI that adapts to every screen size (because we’re all on our phones these days 📱)

🚀 What’s next?
Conversation history (because sometimes you need to remember what you said!)

Voice input (because typing is so 2008 🤔)

Dark Mode (because, well... dark mode = life 🖤)

Persistence — save chat data locally or add a backend (because who wants to lose a chat history?)

Having some issues in responsiveness
I will fix this very soon.

This was more than just writing code — it was about creating an experience. From the first line of HTML to seeing it come alive in a browser, this project taught me how to turn ideas into functioning, live systems.
